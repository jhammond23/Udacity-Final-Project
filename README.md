This project is the ultimate culmination of my previous projects, hosted on a clean, original, and mobile responsive personal portfolio page. 

Using GitHub pages, each project is easily able viewed and interacted with. With a built in Form Submit ‘CONTACT ME’ feature, the site allows
for on-site emails to be sent and received from user to me.

The site also contains an easily accessible link to my resume and a bit into my personal life.

If you have any questions or want to connect, please feel free to use the 'CONTACT ME' feature to send me an email :)
